    "The main focus of this module is to teach you how to effectively train an ML model. Therefore, instead of delving deeply into the underlying theories, we will focus on implementation. In the first section, we will cover three popular data pre-processing techniques: standard scaling, principal component analysis, and label encoding. The second section focuses on ML model training and introduces grid search cross-validation, a parameter tuning method to improve model performance. Finally, the third section covers model evaluation, where we assess its effectiveness using metrics like accuracy and the confusion matrix."
