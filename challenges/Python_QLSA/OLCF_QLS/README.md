# Quantum linear solvers
Contains classical and quantum algorithms to solve systems of linear equations such as the HHL algorithm.

## Installation
```python
git clone https://github.com/anedumla/quantum_linear_solvers.git
cd quantum_linear_solvers
pip install .

Or use this fork updated to Qiskit 1.4.x: https://github.com/agallojr/quantum_linear_solvers
```

## Documentation
This tutorial is based on an older version of this package, which used an older version of Qiskit. The current version of this library uses Qiskit 1.4.x, so these examples won't work as-is. But the gist of the approach remains the same, only the syntax changes.
