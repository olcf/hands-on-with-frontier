## Clone GitHub Repository for this Event
GitHub is a code-hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. We use GitHub to develop and host the code for this event. 

You will need to `clone` a copy of our repository to your `home` directory so that you can complete all of our challenges. Use the following commands to complete this step:
```bash
$ cd /ccs/home/userid
$ git clone https://github.com/olcf/hands-on-with-Frontier-.git
```

Check that you can list the files in your current directory to see the repository directory: 
```bash
$ ls
hands-on-with-Frontier-
```

Finally, move into that directory:
```bash
$ cd hands-on-with-Frontier-
```
