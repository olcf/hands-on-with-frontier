# Basic Unix and Vim Skills

In order to accomplish tasks in any high-performance computing system, you need to know
how to navigate through and issue commands in a UNIX or Linux operating system. Unix-based systems operate through the command-line rather than a graphical user interface (GUI).  In this challenge, you will learn how to see files, make directories, navigate directories, and manipulate files all without a GUI. 


&nbsp;

## The Command Line

The Command Line (also called a command prompt) is a text interface for a computer. It is the place in which you type the commands that will be interpreted and executed by the computer when you enter them.

Below is the command line prompt, you can run programs and navigate through files just like you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on MacOS.
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$
```
>> ---
> This example system has been set up so the userid, the login node, and the system are displayed in brackets before the prompt. Some systems will only start with the "$".
>> ---

As an example, print your userid by typing `whoami` into the command line and pressing `Enter`. 
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ whoami
userid
```

## Work With Directories

You will need to learn to navigate the filesystem in order to find and access your files. The filesystem is a collection of files and directories. 'Directory' is just the UNIX term for 'folders' on Windows.

To put us all in the same starting place, we will issue the `cd` command. This will take us to our home directory. 

Type
```
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ cd
```
Then hit `return`.

The commands in a command line are always executed from the directory you are currently in. You can find out what directory you are currently in with the 'present working directory' command, `pwd`.
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ pwd
/ccs/home/userid
```

You should be in the `/ccs/home/<userid>` directory, where `<userid>` is replaced with your userid. This directory is where you will land by default when you first log in on the terminal. 

The string with forward slashes like e.g. `/ccs/home/userid` is a called a _path_. If you are not already in this directory, you can use the `cd` command to navigate here as we will see next.

Use the `cd` command to 'change directory'. On the command line, type `cd` followed by the _path_ of the target directory. If `pwd` does not show that you are in your `/ccs/home/<userid>` directory, we can use `cd` followed by the path to get there.

```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ cd /ccs/home/userid
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ pwd
/ccs/home/userid
```
>> ---
> Make sure you replace `userid` with your actual userid. We are just using `userid` as an example.
>> ---

&nbsp;

If you have not already cloned the repository, execute `git clone https://github.com/olcf/hands-on-with-frontier/` on the command line to download the 'Hands On With Frontier' repository. 

The output should look something like:
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ git clone https://github.com/olcf/hands-on-with-frontier/
Cloning into 'hands-on-with-frontier'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (829/829), done.
```


Use the `ls` command to see what files and directories are present in your current directory. You should see something similar to this:
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ ls
hands-on-with-frontier
```

From here, lets try using `cd` to get to the `Basic_Unix_Vim` challenge directory in the `hands-on-with-frontier` repository.
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ cd ~/hands-on-with-frontier/challenges/Basic_Unix_Vim
```

This is the path _relative to your current directory_ (which would be `/ccs/home/<userid>`). You can also use the _absolute path_ with `cd` i.e. the path string starting with `/` is called a absolute path. This will take you to the same directory.
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ cd /ccs/home/<userid>/hands-on-with-frontier/challenges/Basic_Unix_Vim
```

Execute `pwd` to check if you're in the right place, and execute `ls` to see what files are available in this directory. 

```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ pwd 
/ccs/home/<userid>/hands-on-with-frontier/challenges/Basic_Unix_Vim
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ ls
images README.md text_file.txt
```

If you want to go back to where you were, remember the previous path you had and use `cd` to navigate there. e.g. `cd /ccs/home/<userid>` . 

```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ cd /ccs/home/userid
[userid@login1.frontier ~]$ pwd
/ccs/home/userid
```

Let us now learn how to create a new directory. Now that you are in the `Basic_Unix_Vim` directory, create a new directory by executing the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the directory. 

For example, create a directory named 'mydirectory' by do the following:
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ mkdir mydirectory 
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ ls
images mydirectory README.md text_file.txt
```

Now we can use that directory to hold files. Lets try using the `cp` command to "copy" a file to the directory. The format is `cp` followed by the name of the file to copy as well as the path of the new location where the file needs to be copied to. 

Try to copy the file `text_file.txt` to the newly created `mydirectory` directory using this command:
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ cp test_file.txt mydirectory
```

Remember that specifying the full path for the file or directory will also work.
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ cp /ccs/home/<userid>/hands-on-with-frontier/challenges/Basic_Unix_Vim/text_file.txt /ccs/home/<userid>/hands-on-with-frontier/challenges/Basic_Unix_Vim/mydirectory
```

You can check the contents of a directory with `ls` without first using `cd` to go to that directory, by using `ls` followed by the path or directory name.
```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ ls mydirectory
text_file.txt
```

You can see that `text_file.txt` has been successfully copied to the directory `mydirectory`.

# Editing Files

We will now learn to edit files using a command line text editor called Vim. Vim is a standard text editor available on almost all systems where you have to use a command
line. It provides the quickest way to view and modify files when you don't have access to graphical text editors that you might be used to.

You should be familiar with the command format by now. To open a file in Vim, execute the `vim` command with the name of the file. Try to open the file `text_file.txt` with Vim.

```bash
[userid@login1.frontier Basic_Unix_Vim]$ vim text_file.txt
```

This will open a window that looks like this:

![vim with text file open](images/vim_with_text_file_open.png)

Vim has two main modes, __Insert Mode__ and __Normal Mode__. When Vim opens a file, it
will always open in Normal Mode. To start actually editing the text, you need to enter
Insert Mode. To do this, press the letter 'i' on your keyboard. You will see the little
indicator on the bottom left appear saying `-- INSERT MODE --` as you can see in the image below.

![screenshot showing insert mode](images/screenshot_showing_insert_mode.png)

Try typing in some sentences. Once you are done, you need to be able to save and/or exit
Vim. To do that, you must first go back to Normal Mode. To go to Normal Mode, press the
`Escape` key or press `Control key + [` on your keyboard. You will see the little `--
INSERT MODE --` indicator disappear as you can see in the image below.

![screenshot showing normal mode](images/screenshot_showing_normal_mode.png)

Once in Normal Mode, you can save by typing on your keyboard `:w` followed by `return`. These characters won't
appear in the main text but will appear in the bottom left. `:w` is the command for Vim to
'write' the file to disk, thus saving the file. 

![screenshot showing :w](images/screenshot_showing_w.png)

You can exit out of Vim and go back to the command line by typing in `:q` followed by `return`. If you haven't
saved, you will get a warning and Vim won't exit, so make sure you save the file with `:w`
first.
